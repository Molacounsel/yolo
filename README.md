# YOLO PROJECT-CREATING A BASIC CONTAINERIZED MICROSERVICE WITH MONGODB, REACT, AND DOCKER 
This project involved using containerization concepts, such as image tagging, Docker networking, image versioning, data persistence, image chaining, and Docker compose to replicate a basic e-commerce website called *Yolomy*. The backend service is powered by Node.js and uses MongoDB to enhance persistence, while the frontend service is built using React. All services can be run using Docker Compose.

## Goals 
This project aimed to accomplish the following goals:
1. Create a frontend service using React
2. Create a backend service using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose
3. Containerize MongoDB using Docker and Docker Compose
4. Deploy backend and frontend images to Dockerhub

## Getting Started
I began by:
1. Forking and cloning the following repository to my local machine:

- Cloning with SSH

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Vinge1718/yolo.git
   ```
2. Then changing to the project repository:

      ```bash
   cd Vinge1718/yolo.git
   ```
